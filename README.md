# hBGW

## Introduction
hBGW is a knowledge network based on graphs and RDF triples to query biological information corresponding to Homo sapiens. hBGW is a model that uses semantic web technologies to integrate information from different databases through a model that, by reusing available resources, aims to standardize biological data and improve web interoperability. In addition, the knowledge network includes biological coordinates to allow the development of query strategies that exploit the location of sequences, an aspect that other semantic biological knowledge networks do not usually exploit.

The knowledge network is available through its endpoint [http://ssb4.nt.ntnu.no:10022/sparql](http://ssb4.nt.ntnu.no:10022/sparql) and SPARQL. A short SPARQL [tutorial](./SPARQL_tutorial.pdf) is available to introduce potencial users to this query language as well as to the use of the knowledge network.

With this contribution we also encourage the community to work on the development of different interoperable knowledge networks to connect domains and allow the development of complex federated queries.
