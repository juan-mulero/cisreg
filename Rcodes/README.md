Each database is pre-processed independently. 

The generated codes use functions available in the [scripts]("./scripts/") folder. The 4.1 version of R was used.

The codes include paths to database files for data loading, but some databases do not allow the automatic loading. In these cases, data were manually downloaded, and loaded using local paths. Therefore, the execution of the codes can require the modification of some of these paths.
